# _NCS4_WebBackup_v2
NCS4 Website Backup files

Open source archive of my work at NCS4.

From now on the production will work like this:

1.  a) Fork repo if not already forked
     b) If forked already or new changes since fork, pull upstream changes from ncs4usm/_NCS4_WebBackup_v2 to your local machine
2.  Push any changes to forked repo (e.g. bsonge/_NCS4_WebBackup_v2)
3.  Create pull request with new changes:  If multiple people are working here each change must be reviewed before merging

For now we will just work with master as there is no need for a production branch and a master branch.
